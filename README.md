# HTML Timeliner

- based on timeliner.js from https://technotarek.com/timeliner/

This version attempts to duplicate most of the functionality using HTML details elements, and a bit of js and CSS.

- accessible out of the box
- style as you like
- use the optional timelineControl.js script to add some useful controls
